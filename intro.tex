\section{Introduction}

The following documents outline the proposal to provide out of hours support to Rubin's infrastructure by DM DevOps team. 

Out of hours support includes events triggered before or after the standard working hours in Chile. Therefore out of hours supports starts on weekdays at 17:30 and ends the next day at 8:30, and run 24 hours on weekends and holidays.
